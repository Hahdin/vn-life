## So I was bored one day...

The first is just a very tiny piece of code that creates an animated [epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) clock component.

The code demonstrates the use of a [javascript Proxy object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) to handle the current time, and displays on an [HTML Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

Below it is a simple animation of some sparkles. I like trying to create realistic or organic animations, and enjoy playing with the canvas. Enjoy.
